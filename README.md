# 2023 House Calendar

Inspired by the house calendar hanging in front of me as I work on my laptop, I decided to recreate it using HTML and CSS. Despite completing the project a while back, I hadn't added it to my GitHub until now. Excited to finally share it!



## Usage
To use the calendar:
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Navigate through the calendar to view different months and dates.
3. Click on specific dates to view events or details associated with them.
